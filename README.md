# Mastermind CLI Game
Console based implementation of the classic logic game **Mastermind**, written in **C# .NET 9**

## Rules
Goal of this game is to crack the secret code generated by the computer within a limited number of rounds.

1. Enter a combination of colors or digits (e.g., `r g b y`).
2. After each guess, the game provides hints:
    - **Accurate answers:** Correct item in the correct position.
    - **Not accurate answers:** Correct item, but in the wrong position.
3. If you guessed correct code in time, you win! If not, well, you know what happens...

## Features
- **Multiple Game Modes**:
    - **Normal**: Classic rules (6 colors, 9 rounds)
    - **Liar Mode**: The game tries to trick you! There is a ~33% chance the feedback is incorrect (happens up to 2 times).
    - **Digits Mode**: Play with numbers (0-9) instead of colors for a higher difficulty (11 rounds).
    - **Custom**: Configure everything, code length, number of colors/digits, rounds, and lie frequency.
- **Save System**: Progress is saved automatically to `savedgamedata.json` after every move. You can safely quit the app and continue later.
- **Dev Mode**: Togglable option to view the secret code for debugging.
